# Everstrike Market Maker

A simple Everstrike market making bot.

## Features

- Support for 120+ trading pairs (options, futures and spot)
- Plug and play (just set your API key and secret key)
- Minimal dependencies (Node-fetch, WS and Async-Limiter)
- Customizable (more than 40 custom parameters)
- Battle tested (has been running on Everstrike Testnet for more than a year)
- Extendable (based on the popular CCXT crypto trading library)
- MIT license

## Requirements

- Docker
- An Everstrike account with an API key and a secret key

## Local Setup

1. Specify your API key and secret key in config/config.json

```javascript
  "API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "SECRET_KEY": "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>",
```

Generate an API key and a secret key here: [https://app.testnet.everstrike.io/app/apikey](https://app.testnet.everstrike.io/app/apikey)

2. Make sure you have Docker installed

```bash
docker version;
```

3. Build and run Docker image

```bash
bash run.sh;
```

Voil√†!

Don't forget to stop your container when you're done.

```bash
docker stop everstrike_mm;
```

The bot automatically cancels all open orders upon being started or shut down.

## Mainnet

The default environment for the bot is the Everstrike Testnet. To configure the bot to use the Everstrike Mainnet instead, run the following command:

```bash
bash run.sh mainnet;
```

## Market making multiple pairs

By default, the bot only market makes a single trading pair (USD_BTC_PERP).

However, it can market make up to 50 pairs at once.

Specify the pairs to include in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "PAIRS": ["USD_BTC_PERP", "USD_ETH_PERP", "USD_BTCCALL_PERP"],
```

Available pairs can be obtained through the /pairs API endpoint:

[https://api.testnet.everstrike.io/pairs](https://api.testnet.everstrike.io/pairs)

Alternatively, you may retrieve them through the official frontend UI at [https://app.testnet.everstrike.io/app/trade](https://app.testnet.everstrike.io/app/trade). Make sure to use the programmatic name of each pair, and not the display name (i.e. for "BTC/USD", use "USD_BTC_PERP" instead of "BTC/USD").

## Configuring number of orders

By default, the bot manages up to four orders per trading pair (two on each side of the spread).

However, it can manage up to 20 orders per trading pair.

Specify the number of orders in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "NUM_ORDERS": 10,
```

## Configuring spread

By default, the bot runs with a medium spread (50 pips wide).

You can configure the spread in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "spread_multiplier": 20,
```

## Configuring long bias

By default, the bot runs with a neutral long bias.

You can configure the long bias in config/config.json.

Positive long bias:

```javascript
  "long_bias": 0.01,
```

Negative long bias (short bias):

```javascript
  "long_bias": -0.01,
```

## Configuring volatility bias

By default, the bot runs with a neutral volatility bias.

You can configure the volatility bias in config/config.json.

Positive volatility bias (long volality):

```javascript
  "volatility_bias": 0.01,
```

Negative volatility bias (short volatility):

```javascript
  "volatility_bias": -0.01,
```

The volatility bias only works for options pairs.

## Configuring order quantity

By default, the bot aims to utilize 10% of your balance.

You can configure the balance target in config/config.json.

For perpetual contracts, modify the "base" property:

```javascript
  "base": 0.30,
```

For spot trading, modify both the "base" and the "quote" properties:

```javascript
  "base": 0.30,
  "quote": 0.40,
```

Note that the target is just a target, and that the bot may overshoot or undershoot the target, depending on the pair quoted. For that reason, it is not recommended to use a balance target that is too high, as doing so may cause orders to fail with insufficient balance errors.

## Turning off buy or sell orders

You may want to make the bot quote in one direction only.

To do so, set "buy" or "sell" to false in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "buy": true,
  "sell": false,
```

## Order placement interval

By default, the bot places orders every 10 seconds.

You can configure the order placement interval in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "order_placement_interval": 20000,
```

## Maximum position

By default, the bot stops placing new orders for a trading pair if you have an active position for that trading pair and the notional value of the position is greater than $10,000,000.

You can configure the maximum position size in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "max_position": 100000,
```

## Maximum exposure

By default, the bot stops placing new orders if your total exposure (combined notional value of all open positions) is greater than $10,000,000.

You can configure the maximum exposure in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "max_exposure": 100000,
```

## Pricing source

By default, the bot uses the Everstrike Index Price as pricing source.

You can change the pricing source to the Everstrike Mark Price in config/config.json:

```javascript
  "use_index": false,
  "use_mark": true,
```

## Further customization

Info coming soon.

## Server

To expose the bot's internal server, run:

```bash
bash serve.sh;
```

Mainnet:

```bash
bash serve.sh mainnet;
```

This will run the bot with port 8081 exposed.

Available endpoints:

- localhost:8081/orders
- localhost:8081/positions
- localhost:8081/balances
- localhost:8081/pnl
- localhost:8081/configure?pair=USD_BTC_PERP&name=Everstrike_MM&long_bias=0.00&volatility_bias=0.00&spread_multiplier=50&buy=true&sell=true

The /configure endpoint mutates internal server state. You can use it to change the long bias, volatility bias and spread for a specific pair, while the bot is running. Simply substitute your desired values into the query string above.

You can check the current configuration of the bot by using the following query:

- localhost:8081/configure?pair=USD_BTC_PERP&name=Everstrike_MM

## Running without bash script

1. Ensure Docker is installed

```bash
docker version;
```

2. Ensure image is not running

```bash
docker rm -f everstrike_mm
```

3. Build image

```bash
docker build -t everstrike_mm .;
```

4. Run image

```bash
docker run -d --name everstrike_mm everstrike_mm;
```

5. Stream logs of image (optional)

```bash
docker logs -f everstrike_mm;
```

NOTE: To use the Mainnet instead of the Testnet, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name everstrike_mm -e TRADING_ENV=mainnet everstrike_mm;
```

## Running without Docker

1. Ensure NPM is installed

```bash
npm version;
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install;
```

3. Start the bot

```bash
npm start;
```

## Understanding config.json

Config.json (found in the path /config/config.json) is central to making the bot behave the way you like.

Here's how it looks, without any configuration:

```javascript
{
  "clients": [
    {
      "API_KEY": "", // Your Everstrike (Testnet) API key
      "SECRET_KEY": "", // Your Everstrike (Testnet) secret key
      "CLIENT_ID": "Everstrike_MM", // A descriptive name of the bot client. Used for logging purposes.
      "OPTIONS": { // The main configuration object
        "PAIRS": ["USD_BTC_PERP"], // Which trading pairs to market make. See above for a list of trading pairs.
        "NUM_ORDERS": 2, // Number of orders to manage for each trading pair (on each side of the spread)
        "MIN_ORDERS": 0, // Minimum number of orders for each trading pair
        "ORDER_PLACEMENT_INTERVAL": 10000, // Interval to wait between order placement
        "PAIR_OPTIONS": {
          "BTC/USD": { // Pair-wise configuration object. If no pair-wise configuration object is specified for a specific pair, the BTC/USD configuration object will be used.
            "base": 0.10, // Percentage of base balance to use (USD for perpetual contracts)
            "quote": 0.10, // Percentage of quote balance to use (only relevant for market making spot pairs)
            "spread_multiplier": 50, // Size of the spread, in pips
            "spread_multiplier_futures": 50, // Size of the spread, in pips, for futures
            "spread_multiplier_options": 50, // Size of the spread, in pips, for options
            "spread_multiplier_spot": 50, // Size of the spread, in pips, for spot
            "order_placement_interval": 10000, // Interval to wait between order placement
            "max_position": 10000000, // Maximum position size in USD (for a single trading pair)
            "max_exposure": 10000000, // Maximum total exposure in USD (across all trading pairs)
            "max_drawdown": 10000000, // Maximum drawdown in USD (across all trading pairs)
            "buy": true, // If buy orders should be submitted
            "sell": true, // If sell orders should be submitted
            "use_index": true, // If the Index Price should be used as a reference price
            "use_mark": false, // If the Mark Price should be used as a reference price
            "is_perp": true, // If the pair is a perpetual contract
            "floor": 0.05,
            "mark_index_spread": 0.00000,
            "submit_even_on_price_changed": true,
            "price_changed_num_orders": 0,
            "refresh_factor": 0.00,
            "spread_buffer": 0.01,
            "stale_buffer": 2,
            "scale_fn_base": 1.1, // Scaling function for order quantities
            "long_bias": 0.00, // Long bias
            "volatility_bias": 0.00 // Volatility bias
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: You don't necessarily need to specify a configuration for each trading pair that you are market making. Specifying a configuration for BTC/USD (as seen in the example above) will usually be enough. All other trading pairs will automatically default to this configuration object.

You only need to specify a configuration for a trading pair if you want fine-tuned configuration for that specific trading pair.

## Rate limits

The bot has built-in rate-limiting. The default rate limit used by the bot is 50 orders per 30 seconds, and 500 orders per 3 minutes. You can modify this by adding the following to the OPTIONS object of config.json:

```javascript
"ORDER_PLACEMENT_INTERVAL": 10000, // interval between order placements
"THIRTY_SECOND_ORDER_LIMIT": 50, // maximum orders per thirty seconds
"THREE_MINUTE_ORDER_LIMIT": 500, // maximum orders per three minutes
"RECV_WINDOW": 5000, // reject order requests that exceed this latency
```

Note: The bot may run into rate limits if you try to market make more than 30 pairs at once. If you intend to market make more than 30 pairs, you should run multiple bot instances, and split the pairs between them.

## Errors

- "503 Service Unavailable" - This is a generic rate-limiting error. May happen if you try to market make more trading pairs than the rate limits of the Everstrike REST API support.
- "DDOSProtection: Everstrike POST https://api.testnet.everstrike.io/auth/cancel/bulk 429 Too Many Requests {"code":429,"msg":"You have done that too much recently. Care to try again in 0.043 seconds?","result":null}" - Same as above.
- "408 Request Timeout {"code":414,"msg":"The timestamp is too old.","result":null}" - This indicates that a request timed out. It may be due to a slow or unstable network connection, or a throttled CPU.
- "ExchangeNotAvailable: Everstrike POST https://api.testnet.everstrike.io/auth/order/bulk  fetch failed" - Same as above.

## Slack notifications

You can configure the bot to send Slack notifications on order fills. To do so, fill out the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL property in config/config.json.
